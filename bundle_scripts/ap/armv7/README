Patches:
nor - disable sigchecks in llb/iboot/ibss/ibec
kernelcache_armv7 - disable sigchecks and sandboxing
kernelcache_patchedNorProcs_armv7 - above plus allow flashing unsigned nor files (only relevant for devices succeptible to the 24K exploit)
asr - patches asr on 4.2; doesn't work on 4.1 (they made the code relocatable which changed binary patterns significantly)
