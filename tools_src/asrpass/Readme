How to find 'getpassphrase' proc:
0. Use https://github.com/msftguy/ios-jb-tools/blob/master/tools_src/idapy/rel_addr_llvm.py to fix xrefs on iOS5, until it's fixed in IDA (not fixed yet as of 6.1)
1. The name 'getpassphrase isn't the one Apple gave it, just how I think it should be named
2. It calls the proc that does the actual work (getpassphrase_main) with two args: volume mount point and platform name.
3. It the only xref of cfstr_PlatformName (which is a constant CFStringRef that xrefs "platform-name" string)
4. getpassphrase_main calls ioctl with args 0x40046418 and 0x40086419 - you can check _ioctl xrefs to locate it
5. Don't forget to add 1 to the address if it's a Thumb proc, duh
6. Use -h option in modified genpass (https://github.com/msftguy/genpass) to derive the vfdecrypt key from password and rootfs dmg
